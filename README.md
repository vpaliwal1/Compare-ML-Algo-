# Compare-ML-Algo-

In this project, I used the dataset from UCI repository to classify whether a person is having heart disease or not. I compare the multiple machine learning algorithms to get an idea that which algorithm is giving best result for this problem. I have already defined my work for this problem in my notebook step by step.

Steps:
1. Load the Dataset.
2. Preprocess the data.
3. Visualize the data.
4. Train models to find accuracy.
